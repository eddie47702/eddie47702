- 👋 Hi, I’m @eddie47702
- 👀 I’m interested in creating Raspberry Pi projects in ANSI-C or Python that use the GPIO bus.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and I have already made a pool heater controller in Python with graphical display and 
- a Raspberry Pi robot controller that points a platform at the sun as it traverses the sky daily (and they work!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ANSI-C and the GPIO bus.
